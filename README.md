# Software Access Management System

A role-based access control application for managing software resources and access requests across different user roles: **Admin**, **Manager**, and **Employee**.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project is designed to streamline software resource management within an organization by providing different functionalities based on user roles:

- **Admin:** Full control over software lifecycle and request approvals.
- **Manager:** Authority to approve or reject access requests.
- **Employee:** Ability to browse software inventory, request access, and track request statuses.

This system ensures secure, scalable, and maintainable user management with JWT authentication and role-based authorization.
